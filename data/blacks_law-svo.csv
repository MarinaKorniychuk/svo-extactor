debt,debt,be,sum,https://thelawdictionary.org/debt/,"A debt is a sum of money due by contract. It is most frequently due by a certain and express agreement, which fixes the amount, independent of extrinsic circumstances. But it is not essential that the contract should be express, or that it should fix the precise amount to be paid. U. S. v. Colt, 1 Pet. C C. 145, Fed. Cas. No. 14.S39. Standing alone, the word “debt” is as applicable to a sum of money which lias been promised at a future day. as to a sum of money now due and payable. To distinguish between the two. It may be said of the former that it is a debt owing, and of the latter that it is a debt due. Whether a claim or demand is a debt or not is in no respect determined by a reference to the time of payment. A sum of money which is certainly and in all events payable is a debt, without regard to the fact whether it be payable now or at a future time. A sum payable upon a contingency, however, is not a debt, or does not become a debt until the contingency has happened. People v. Arguello. 37 Cal. 524. The word “debt” is of large import, including not only debts of record, or judgments,and debts by specialty, but also obligations arising under simple contract, to a very wide extent; and in its popular sense includes all that is due to a man under any form of obligation or promise. Gray v. Bennett, 3 Mete. (Mass.) 522, 520. “Debt” has been differently defined, owing to the different subject-matter of the statutes in which it has been used. Ordinarily, it imports a sum of money arising upon a contract, express or implied. In its more general sense, it is defined to be that which is due from one person to another, whether money, goods, or services; that which one person is bound to pay or perform to another. Under the legal-tender statutes, it seems to import any obligation by contract, express or implied, which may be discharged by money through the voluntary action of the party bound. Wherever he may be at liberty to perform his obligation by the payment of a specific sum of money, the party owing the obligation is subject to what, in these statutes, is termed “debt.” Kimpton v. Bronson, 45 Barb. (N. Y.) 618. The word is sometimes used to denote an aggregate of separate debts, or the total sum of the existing claims against a person or company. Thus we speak of the “national debt,” the “bonded debt” of a corporation, etc. Synonyms. The term “demand” is of much broader import than “debt,” and embraces rights of action belonging to the debtor beyond those which could appropriately be called “debts.” In this respect the term “demand” Is one of very extensive import. In re Denny, 2 Hill (N. Y.) 223. The words “debt” and “liability” are not synonymous. As applied to the pecuniary relations of parties, liability is a term of broader significance than debt. The legal acceptation of debt is a sum of money due by certain and express agreement. Liability is responsibility; the state of one who is bound in law and justice to do something which may be enforced by action. This liability may arise from contracts either express or implied, or in consequence of torts committed. McElfresh v. Kirkendall. 36 Iowa, 226. “Debt” is not exactly synonymous with “duty.” A debt is a legal liability to pay a specific sum of money; a duty is a legal obligation to perform some act. Allen v. Dickson, Minor (Ala.) 120. In practice. The name of a common-law action, which lies to recover a certain specific sum of money, or a sum that can readily be reduced to a certainty. 3 Bl. Comm. 154; 3 Steph. Comm. 461; 1 Tidd. Pr. 3. It is said to lie in the debet and detinet, (when it is stated that the defendant owes and detains.) or in the detinet, (when it is stated merely that he detains.) Debt in the detinet for goods differs from detinue, because it is not essential in this action, as in detinue, that the specific property in the goods should have been vested in the plaintiff at the time the action is brought. Dyer, 246."

Parol evidence is not ordinarily admissible to explain this. When used with reference to civil and criminal responsibility, a person who contemplates any result, as not unlikely to follow from a deliberate act of his own, may be said to intend that result, whether he desire it or not. Thus, if a man should, for a wager, discharge a gun among a multitude of people, and any should be killed, he would be deemed guilty of intending the death of such person: for every man is presumed to intend the natural consequence of his own actions. Intention is often confounded with motive, as when we speak of a man’s “good intentions.” Mozley & Whitley"

benefit of clergy,sense phrase,denote,exemption,https://thelawdictionary.org/benefit-of-clergy/,"In its original sense, the phrase denoted the exemption which was accorded to clergymen from the jurisdiction of the secular courts, or from arrest or attachment on criminal process issuing from those courts in certain particular cases. Afterwards, it meant a privilege of exemption from the punishment of death accorded to such persons as were clerks, or who could read. This privilege of* exemption from capital punishment was anciently allowed to clergymen only, but afterwards to all who were connected with the church, even to its most subordinate officers, and at a still later time to all persons who could read, (then called “clerks,”) whether ecclesiastics or laymen. It does not appear to have been extended to cases of high treason, nor did it apply to mere misdemeanors. The privilege was claimed after the person’s conviction, by a species of motion in. arrest of judgment, technically called “praying his clergy.” As a means of testing his clerical character, he was given a psalm to read, (usually, or always, the fifty- first,) and, upon his reading it correctly, he was turned over to the ecclesiastical courts, to be tried by the bishop or a jury of twelve clerks. These heard him on oath, with his witnesses and compurgators, who attested their belief in his innocence. This privilege operated greatly to mitigate the extreme rigor of the criminal laws, but was found to involve such gross abuses that parliament began to enact that certain crimes should be felonies “without benefit of clergy,” and finally, by St. 7 Geo. IV. c. 28,"

"in personam, in rem",actio in personam,be,remedy claim,https://thelawdictionary.org/in-personam-in-rem/,"In the Roman law, from which they are taken, the expressions”in rem” and “in personam” were always opposed to one another, an act or proceeding in personam being one done or directed against or with reference to a specific person, while an act or proceeding in rem was one done or directed with reference to no specific person, and consequently against or with reference to all whom it might concern, or “all the world.” The phrases were especially applied to actions; an actio in personam being the remedy where a claim against a specific person arose out of an obligation, whether ex contractu or ex malcficio. while an actio in rem was one brought for the assertion of a right of property, easement, status, etc., against one who denied or infringed it. See Inst. 4, 6, 1; Gains, 4, 1, 1-10; 5 Sav. Syst. 13, et seq.; Dig. 2, 4, 7,8; Id. 4. 2, 9, 1.From this use of the terms, they have come to be applied to signify the antithesis of”available against a particular person,” and “available against the world at large.” Thus,jura in personam are rights primarily available against specific persons; jura in rem.rights only available against the world at large.So a judgment or decree is said to be in rem when it binds third persons. Such Is The sentence of a court of admiralty on a question of prize, or a decree of nullity or dissolution of marriage, or a decree of a court in a foreign country as to the status of a person domiciled there.Lastly, the terms are sometimes used to signify that a judicial proceeding operates on a thing or a person. Thus, it is said of the court of chancery that it acts in personam-, and not in rem, meaning that its decrees operate by compelling defendants to do what they are ordered to do, and not by producing the effect directly. Sweet. See Cross v.Armstrong, 44 Ohio St 613, 10 N. E. 160; Cunningham v. Shanklin, 60 Cal. 125; Hill y.Henry, 66 N. J.

void,void,do imply,entire nullity,https://thelawdictionary.org/void/,"Null; Ineffectual; nugatory; having no legal force or binding effect; unable, in law, to support the purpose for which it was intended. “Void” does not always imply entire nullity; but it is, in a legal sense, subject to large qualifications iu view of all the circumstances calling for its application, and the rights and interests to be affected in a given case. Brown v. Brown, 50 N. II. 53S, 552. “Void,” as used in statutes and by the courts, does not usually mean that the act or proceeding is in absolute nullity. Kearney v. Vaugliau, 50 Mo. 2S4. There is this difference between the two words “void” and “voidable;” void means that an instrument or transaction is so nugatory and ineffectual that nothing can cure it; voidable, when an imperfection or defect can be cured by the act or confirmation of him who could take advantage of it Thus, while acceptance of rent will make good a voidable lease, it will not alter in a void lease. Wharton. The true distinction between void and voidable acts, orders, and judgments is that the former can always be assailed in any proceeding, and the latter only in a direct proceeding. Alexander v. Nelson. 42 Ala. 462. The term “void.” as applicable to conveyances or other agreements, has not at all times been used with technical precision, nor restricted to its peculiar and limited sense, as contradistinguished from “voidable;” it being frequently introduced, even by legal writers and jurists, when the purpose is nothing further than to indicate that a contract was invalid, and not binding in law. But the distinction between the terms “void” and “voidable,” in their application to contracts, is often one of great practical importance; and, whenever entire technical accuracy is required, the term “void” can only be properly applied to those contracts that are of no effect whatsoever, such as are a mere nullity, and incapable of confirmation or ratification. Allis v. Billings, 6 Mete. (Mass.) 415, 30 Am. Dec. 744. Void in part, void in toto. Curtis v. Leavitt, 15 N. Y. 9, 90. Void things are as no things. People v. Shall, 9 Cow. (N. Y.) 778, 7S4."

in american law,one,be,member,https://thelawdictionary.org/in-american-law/,"One who, under the constitution and laws of the United States, or of a particular state, and by virtue of birth or naturalization within the jurisdiction, is a member of the political community, owing allegiance and being entitled to the enjoyment of full civil rights. U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 512, 23 L. Ed. 5S8; White v. Clements, 39 Ga. 259; Amy v. Smith, 1 Litt. (Ky.) 331; State v. County Court, 90 Mo. 593, 2 S. W. 7S8; Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 1G2, 22 L. Ed. 027; U. S. v. Morris (D. C.) 125 Fed. 325. The tenn “citizen” has come to us derived from antiquity. It appears to have been used in the Roman government to designate a person who had the freedom of the city, and the right to exercise all political and civil privileges of the government. There was also, at Rome, a partial citizenship, including civil, but not political, rights. Complete citizenship embraced both. Thomasson v. State, 15 Ind. 451. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. Amend. XIV, Const. U. S. There is in our political system a government of each of the several states, and a government of the United States. Each is distinct from the others, and has citizens of its own. who owe it allegiance, and whose rights, within its jurisdiction, it must protect. The same person may be at the same time a citizen of the United States and a citizen of a state; but his rights of citizenship under one of these governments will be different from those he has under the other. The government of the United States, although it is, within the scope of its powers, supreme and beyond the states, can neither grant nor secure to its citizens rights or privileges which are not expressly or by implication placed under its jurisdiction. All that cannot be so granted or secured are left to the exclusive protection of the states. U. S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 23 L. Ed. 588. “Citizen” and “inhabitant” are not synonymous. One may be a citizen of a state without being an inhabitant, or an inhabitant without being a citizen. Quinby v. Duncan, 4 Har. (Del!) 383. “Citizen” is sometimes used as synonymous with “resident;” as in a statute authorizing funds to be distributed among the religious societies of a township, proportionably to the number of their members who are citizens of the township. State v. Trustees, 11 Ohio, 24. In English law. An inhabitant of a city. 1 Rolle, 138. The representative of a city, in parliament. 1 Bl. Comm. 174. It will be perceived that In the English usage, the CITIZENSHIP 203 CIVIL DAMAGE ACTS word adheres closely to Its original meaning, as shown by its derivation, (ciuis, a free inhabitant of a city.) When it is designed to designate an inhabitant of the country, or one amenable to the laws of the nation, “subject” is the word there employed."

State v. Avery, 113 Mo. 475, 21 S. W. 193; Howard v. State, 34 Ark. 433; State v. Evans, 1 Marvel (Del.) 477, 41 Atl. 136; Comm. v. Webster, 5 Cush. (Mass.) 319, 52 Am. Dec. 711; Gardner v. Preston, 2 Day (Conn.) 205. 2 Am. Dec. 91; State v. Miller, 9 Houst. (Del.) 564, 32 Atl. 137. When the existence of any fact is attested by witnesses, as having come under the cognizance of their senses, or is stated in documents, the genuineness and veracity of which there seems no reason to question, the evidence of that fact is said to be direct or positive. When, on the contrary, the existence of the principal fact is only inferred from one or more circumstances which have been established directly, the evidence is said to be circumstantial. And when the existence of the principal fact does not follow from the evidentiary facts as a necessary consequence of the law of nature, but is deduced from them by a process of probable reasoning, the evidence and proof are said to be presumptive. Best, Pres. 240; Id. 12. All presumptive evidence is circumstantial, because necessarily derived from or made up of circumstances, but all circumstantial evidence is not presumptive, that is, it does not operate in the way of presumption, being sometimes of a higher grade, and lending to necessary conclusions, instead of probable ones.

judgment in rem,judgment in rem,be,adjudication,https://thelawdictionary.org/judgment-in-rem/,"A judgment in rem is an adjudication, pronounced upon the status of some particular subject-matter, by a tribunal having competent authority for that purpose. It differs from a judgment in personam, in this: that the latter judgment is in form, as well as substance, between the parties claiming the right; and that it is so inter partes appears by the record itself. It is binding only upon the parties appearing to be such by the record, aud those claiming by them. A judgment in rem is founded on a proceeding instituted, not against the person, as such, but against or upon the thing or subject-matter itself, whose state or condition is to be determined. It is a proceeding to determine the state or condition of the thing itself; and the judgment is a solemn declaration upon the status of the thing, and it ipso facto renders it what it declares it to be. Woodruff v. Taylor, 20 Vt. 73. And see Martin v. King, 72 Ala. 360: Lord v. Cliadbourne, 42 Me. 429. 66 Am. Dec. 290; Hine v. IIus- sey, 45 Ala. 496; Cross v. Armstrong, 44 Ohio St. 613. 10 N. E. 100. Various definitions have been given of a judgment in rem, but all are criticised as either incomplete or comprehending too much. It is generally said to be a judgment declaratory of the status of some subject-matter, whether this be a person or a thing. Thus, the probate of a will fixes the status of the document as a will. The personal rights and interests which follow are mere incidental results of the status or character of the paper, and do not appear on the face of the judgment So, a decree establishing or dissolving a marriage is a judgment in rem, because it fixes the status of the person. A judgment of forfeiture, by the proper tribunal, against specific articles or goods, for a violation of the revenue laws, is a judgment in rem. But it is objected that the customary definition does not fit such a case, because there is no fixing of the status of anything, the whole effect being a seizure, whatever the thing may be. In the foregoing instances, and many others, the judgment is conclusive against all the world, without reference to actual presence or participation in the proceedings. If the expression “strictly in rem” may be applied to any class of cases, it should be confined to such as these. “A very able writer says: ‘The distin. guishing characteristic of judgments in rem is that, wherever their obligation is recognized and enforced as against any person, it is equally recognized and enforced as against alt persons.’ It seems to us that the true definition of a ‘judgment in rem’ is ‘an adjudication’ against some person or thing, or upon the status of some subject-matter; which, wherever and whenever binding upon any person, is equally binding upon all persons.” Bartero v. Real Estate Savings Bank, 10 Mo. App. 78. Judicandum est legibus, non exempli*. Judgment is to be given according to the laws, not according to examples or precedents. 4 Coke, 336; 4 IU.

hallucination,nothing,strike,his ear,https://thelawdictionary.org/hallucination/,"In medical jurisprudence. A trick or deceit of the senses; a morbiderror either of the sense of sight or that of hearing, or possibly of the other senses; apsychological state, such as would be produced naturally by an act of sense-perception,attributed confidently, but mistakenly, to something which has no objective existence ;as, when the patient imagines that he sees an object when there is none, or hears avoice or other sound when nothing strikes his ear. See Staples v. Wellington, 58 Me.459; Foster v. Dickerson, 64 Vt 233, 24 Atl. 257; McNett v. Cooper (C. C.) 13 Fed. 590;People v. Krist 168 N. Y. 19, 60 N. E. 1057.Hallucination does not by itself constitute insanity, though it may be evidence of it ora sign of its approach. It is to be distinguished from “delusion” in this, that the latter isa fixed and irrational belief in the existence of a fact or state of facts, not cognizablethrough the senses, but to be determined by the faculties of reason, memory,judgment, and the like; while hallucination is a belief in the existence of an externalobject, perceptible by the senses, but having no real existence; or, in so far as adelusion may relate to an external object, it is an irrational belief as to the character,nature, or appearance of something which really exists and affects the senses. Forexample, if a man should believe that he saw his right hand in its proper place, after ithad been amputated, it would be an hallucination; but if he believed that his right handwas made of glass, it would be a delusion. In other words, in the case of hallucination,the senses betray the mind, while in the case of delusion, the senses act normally, buttheir evidence is rejected by the mind on account of the existence of an irrational beliefformed independently of them.

These are also sometimes called “political corporations.” People v. McAdams, 82 111. 356; Wooster v. Plymouth, 62 N. H. 208; Goodwin v. East Hartford, 70 Conn. 18, 38 Atl. 876; Dean v.

Private corporations are those founded by and composed of private individuals, for private purposes, as distinguished from governmental purposes, and having no political or governmental franchises or duties.

The true distinction between public and private corporations is that the former are organized for governmental purposes, the latter not. The term “public” has sometimes been applied to corporations of which the government owned the entire stock, as in the case of a state bank. But bearing in mind that “public” is here equivalent to “political,” it will be apparent that this is a misnomer. Again the fact that the business or operations of a corporation may directly and very extensively affect the general public (as in the case of a railroad company or a bank or an insurance company) is no reason for calling it a public corporation. If organized by private persons for their own advantage,"
