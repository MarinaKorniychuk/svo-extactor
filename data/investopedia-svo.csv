The method involves deploying 90% of one's investment capital into interest-bearing instruments which present a lower degree of investment risk while allocating the remaining 10% of money towards higher-risk investments. This system is a relatively conservative investment strategy which aims to generate higher yields on the overall portfolio.

However, much depends on the quality of the interest-bearing bonds purchased."
