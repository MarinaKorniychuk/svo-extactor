Unsecured loans—sometimes referred to as signature loans or personal loans—are approved without the use of property or other assets as collateral. The terms of such loans, including approval and receipt, are therefore most often contingent on the borrower's credit score.

When the maturity of liabilities is shorter than the maturity of assets, the payments associated with the liabilities will come due, but income from the assets may not yet be available due to the longer maturity date. This is the opposite of asset/liability matching, where the maturities of assets and liabilities are the same.

In 1713, Swiss mathematician Jakob Bernoulli proved this theorem in his book Ars Conjectandi. It was later refined by other noted mathematicians, such as Pafnuty Chebyshev, founder of the St. Petersburg mathematical school.

It works with the law of supply to explain how market economies allocate resources and determine the prices of goods and services that we observe in everyday transactions. The law of demand states that quantity purchased varies inversely with price. In other words, the higher the price, the lower the quantity demanded. This occurs because of diminishing marginal utility. That is, consumers use the first units of an economic good they purchase to serve their most urgent needs first, and use each additional unit of the good to serve successively lower valued ends."

Ideally, the asset will eventually produce enough money to cover those costs. These losses can be beneficial to the owner's tax bill in certain instances. Depending on the investor's home country, the shortfall between income earned and interest due can be deducted from current income taxes.

This metric is very similar to the valuation metric of price to cash flow but is considered a more exact measure, owing to the fact that it uses free cash flow, which subtracts capital expenditures (CAPEX) from a company's total operating cash flow, thereby reflecting the actual cash flow available to fund non-asset-related growth. Companies use this metric when they need to expand their asset bases either in order to grow their businesses or simply to maintain acceptable levels of free cash flow."

The ratio uses operating cash flow which adds back non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization to net income. It is especially useful for valuing stocks that have positive cash flow but are not profitable because of large non-cash charges.
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-to-bookratio.asp,Price-To-Book – P/B Ratio,"Companies use the price-to-book ratio to compare a firm's market to book value by dividing the price per share by book value per share (BVPS).

This control can leave the leading firm's rivals with little choice but to follow its lead and match the prices if they are to hold on to their market share. Price leadership is common in oligopolies, such as the airline industry, in which a dominant company sets the prices and other airlines feel compelled to adjust their prices to match."
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricefixing.asp,Price Fixing,"Price fixing is setting the price of a product or service, rather than allowing it to be determined naturally through free-market forces. Although antitrust legislation makes it illegal for businesses to fix their prices under specific circumstances, there is no legal protection against government price fixing. In an ill-fated attempt to end the Great Depression, for example, Franklin Roosevelt forced businesses to fix prices in the 1930s. However, this action may have actually prolonged the downturn."

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-action.asp,Price Action,"Price action is the movement of a security's price plotted over time. Price action forms the basis for all technical analysis of a stock, commodity or other asset chart. Many short-term traders rely exclusively on price action and the formations and trends extrapolated from it to make trading decisions.
